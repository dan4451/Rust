## README for Plugin Info

**BiTurbo plugin**

All modular cars are now equiped with a turbo and are tuned to deliver more horsepower. Just hold right click to open the wastegate and prepare to see some flames in your wake!

**TowCars plugin**

I wanted to give some more utility to cars in rust. Sometimes I want to pull other cars around and this plugin will let you do that. 
First take out your hammer 
Next middle click on the car you are pulling with
Then middle click on the car you want to tow
To remove the hook, just middle click on one of the two cars.
